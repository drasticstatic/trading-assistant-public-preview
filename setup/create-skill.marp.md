## What Is a Skill?

A **skill** is a structured prompt file in `.claude/skills/` that gives Claude a repeatable, high-quality procedure for a specific task.

> Think of it as a *saved workflow* — not a script, not a rule, but a detailed set of instructions that loads only when needed.

**Key facts:**
- Only the **3-line header** is read at context start
- Full body loads **only when triggered** — saves tokens
- Works alongside CLAUDE.md and memory
- **Portable open standard** — not locked to Claude Code

---

## The File Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  TRIGGER when: [specific conditions].
  Do NOT use for: [anti-triggers].
---

# Skill: /skill-name

## Before Starting
## Steps
## Output Format
## After Completing
```

The `description` field controls **everything**.

---

## The 7 Hacks

1. Debug with description echo
2. **Negative triggers matter more than positive ones**
3. Skills stack with CLAUDE.md and memory
4. Build from past conversations
5. Description is everything
6. Laziness workaround
7. Skills are portable

---

## Hack #1 — Debug with Description Echo

**Ask Claude:** "When would you use the [skill-name] skill?"

Claude quotes the description back verbatim.

This instantly reveals:
- What's **too vague** (fires on everything)
- What's **too narrow** (never fires)
- Whether the anti-trigger is **specific enough**

> Run this before deploying any skill.

---

## Hack #2 — Negative Triggers First

The **`Do NOT use for:`** line prevents skill hijacking.

**Write it FIRST.** Before the positive triggers.

| Bad ❌ | Good ✅ |
|--------|---------|
| "Do NOT use for non-trading tasks" | "Do NOT use for: weekly reviews (use /weekly-review), single-trade analysis, or when no fills occurred" |

The anti-trigger should be **more specific** than the positive trigger.

---

## Hack #3 — Skills Stack

**Three layers. Don't duplicate across them.**

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Context, rules, privacy boundaries |
| **Skills** | Process — how to do a task |
| **Memory** | Voice, history, preferences |

Skills handle *process*.
CLAUDE.md handles *context and rules*.
Memory handles *voice and history*.

---

## Hack #4 — Build From Past Conversations

> "The best skill prompts are reverse-engineered from prompts that already worked."

**Don't start from scratch.** Find the conversation where Claude did the task well. Pull that prompt. Strip the one-time context. Generalize it.

Your past sessions are the raw material.

---

## Hack #5 — Description Is Everything

**Too vague** → skill hijacks conversations it shouldn't
**Too broad** → same problem
**Too narrow** → skill never fires

Test both failure modes before finalizing:
1. Try a trigger phrase → does it fire?
2. Try a neighboring phrase → does it NOT fire?

Use **[makemyskill.com](https://makemyskill.com)** to refine descriptions — paste the description, the longer the better.

---

## Hack #6 — Laziness Workaround

If Claude cuts corners inside a skill:

**Don't edit the skill file.**

Add this to the **invocation prompt**:
> "Take your time. Quality over speed. Don't skip steps."

Editing the skill to force quality creates fragility.
The invocation prompt is the right place to adjust intensity.

---

## Hack #7 — Skills Are Portable

The `.md` skill format is an **open standard**.

- Works in Claude Code CLI
- Works in VSCode extension
- Designed to transfer across platforms
- Can be shared with other Claude Code users

> Build skills worth sharing.

---

## The makemyskill.com Workflow

For skills you'll use every day:

1. Copy just the `description` section
2. Paste into **[makemyskill.com](https://makemyskill.com)**
3. Describe the skill — the **longer the better**
4. Replace your description with the refined version
5. Re-test with the debug trick

Optional but recommended for: `/goodmorning`, `/trade-review`, `/premarket`

## makemyskill.com — Quality Analysis

We ran all 9 trading-assistant skills through the tool. Here's what improved:

| Skill | Value Added | Verdict |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `/premarket` | High — section templates, FCR/SMT definitions, Why/What Not/Pitfalls | ✅ Worth running |
| `/trade-review` | High — Data Source Priorities, Common Patterns, Key Principles | ✅ Worth running |
| `/create-skill` | High — Generation Workflow, Quality Checklist, Strong vs Weak examples | ✅ Worth running |
| `/daily-review` | Medium — extra triggers, Common Scenarios, Quality Checklist | ✅ Worth running |
| `/marp-deck` | Medium — theme rationale, example deck structure | ✅ Worth running |
| `/goodmorning` | Medium — Why this matters per step, Edge Cases | ✅ Worth running |
| `/weekly-review` | Low — expanded triggers + Key Principles only | ⚠️ Marginal |
| `/goodnight` | Near zero — trigger phrases only + introduced a typo | ⏭️ Skip next time |
| `/monthly-audit` | Near zero — confirmed solid, cosmetic header changes only | 💡 Quality signal |

> **Key pattern:** The better the input skill, the less the tool improved it. A "near zero" result means your skill is already solid — not a failure.

**Bonus:** The best unexpected output was `/marp-quick-reference.md` — a standalone Marp syntax cheatsheet nobody asked for.

---

## The /create-skill Skill

**Use it:** "create a skill for [task]" → Fortuna drafts the full file.

**What it does:**
- Writes description first (Do NOT use for → positive triggers)
- Follows the 7 rules automatically
- Runs the self-review before saving
- Reminds you to test with the debug trick
- Includes a makemyskill.com submission step

**Generation workflow:**
1. Describe what the skill should do
2. Fortuna drafts → review the description with the echo test
3. Submit description to [makemyskill.com](https://makemyskill.com) if sparse
4. Save to `.claude/skills/` and register in MEMORY.md

> Skills built with `/create-skill` are tracked in a roadmap in `setup/system-overview.md`.

## Skills in This Repo

| Skill | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `/trade-review` | "create review for this trade" |
| `/daily-review` | "daily review for [date]" |
| `/weekly-review` | "weekly review" |
| `/premarket` | "create premarket" |
| `/goodmorning` | "good morning" / "start session" |

| `/session-sync` | "sync everything" / "commit and push" |
| `/level-brief` | "what are the levels" / "level brief" |
| `/smt-scan` | "SMT scan" / "check the indices" |
| `/eval-progress` | "eval status" / "how close am I to payout" |

| `/import-trades` | "import trades" / "process the CSV" |
| `/tax-entry` | "log this for tax" / "add to tax log" |
| `/create-skill` | "create a skill for X" |
| `/startup` (global) | "startup" — any repo |

---

## Deploying to Other Repos

```bash
# Copy a skill to a spoke repo
cp .claude/skills/create-skill.md \
   /path/to/spoke-repo/.claude/skills/
```

**Rules:**
- Only copy skills **relevant** to that repo's workflow
- Non-trading repos get `/create-skill` + `/startup` only
- `.claude/` is **gitignored** everywhere — skills are local to each machine

---

## Scripts in Skills — The Pattern

Add a `## Quick Commands` section to every skill.

**Why:** Saves tokens. Ensures consistency. No re-deriving paths.

```markdown
## Quick Commands
```bash
# The exact command, flags, and paths — pre-built
pngquant --quality=65-80 --speed=1 ... data/screenshots/*.png
git add smarttrader-ai/reviews/ && git commit -m "..."
git push origin main
` `` ← (remove space)
```

The skill body handles *reasoning*. Quick Commands handle *execution*.

---

## Example: /marp-deck

The `/marp-deck` skill converts any review doc to slides.

Its `## Quick Commands` section:

```bash
# Generate HTML — skill deck (public, in setup/)
marp setup/create-skill.marp.md -o setup/create-skill.marp.html

# Generate HTML — coach-share deck (in exports/)
marp smarttrader-ai/exports/YYYY/MM-Mon/[name].marp.md \
     -o smarttrader-ai/exports/YYYY/MM-Mon/[name].marp.html

# Commit
git add setup/*.marp.md setup/*.marp.html && \
  git commit -m "Add [topic] Marp deck [date]"
```

**Public Marp files go in `setup/` — gitignored `.claude/` stays local.**

---

# Start Building

> Every skill you create saves the next session from re-explaining the same process.

**First skill to build:** The one you just explained to Claude.

Go back to that conversation. Find the prompt that worked. That's your skill body.
